/*
A small module that allows local MP3 files to be saved and livestreamed. If a user attempts to download a file, they'll only be able to download what's currently being streamed to Spark. This obviously will not fully protect files from being illegally downloaded - mind you, most music is copyrighted - but it will deter them a bit.
